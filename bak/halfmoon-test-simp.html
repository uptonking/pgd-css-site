                    The weather forecast didn't say that, but the steel plate in

                        He had learned over the years to trust his hip over the
                        weatherman.

                        It was going to rain, so he better get outside and
                        prepare.

                            Sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes
                            things don't work out as planned.

                            This had been his life for the last three months and
                            he was just beginning to get used to it.

                  <li>
                    He didn't actually enjoy it, but he had accepted it and come
                    to terms with it. Or at least he thought he had.

                  <li>
                    All that changed when he put the key into the ignition,
                    turned it and the engine didn't make a sound.
